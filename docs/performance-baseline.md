   - Risk: May saturate beyond 300-400 concurrent users
   - Mitigation: Horizontal scaling, clustering

2. **Memory Usage** (Not measured, to be monitored)
   - Action: Add memory profiling in production
   - Set alerts at 512MB (warning), 1GB (critical)

3. **Database Connections** (Mocked in test)
   - Current config: 20 connections pool limit
   - Recommendation: Monitor pool usage in production
