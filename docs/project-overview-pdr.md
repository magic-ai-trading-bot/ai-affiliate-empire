# AI Affiliate Empire - Product Design & Requirements

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Architecture Phase Complete
**Target**: $10,000+/month autonomous revenue

## Vision

Fully autonomous AI-powered affiliate marketing system that discovers products, generates video + written content, publishes across platforms, tracks conversions, and self-optimizes—all without human intervention.

## Core Value Proposition

**Zero-to-Revenue Automation**: One-time setup → system runs forever, learning and optimizing to maximize affiliate commissions.

**Key Innovation**: 24-hour control loop combining AI content generation, multi-platform publishing, analytics feedback, and self-optimization strategies.

## System Overview

### What It Does

1. **Discovers** affiliate networks and products automatically
2. **Ranks** products by profit potential using AI + social trends
3. **Generates** video scripts, voiceovers, videos, thumbnails, blog posts
4. **Publishes** to YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, blog
5. **Tracks** views, clicks, conversions, revenue across platforms
6. **Learns** from performance data to improve content and strategy
7. **Scales** winners, kills losers, adjusts allocation autonomously

### What Makes It Different

- **100% Autonomous**: No human intervention after setup
- **Self-Optimizing**: A/B tests prompts, kills poor niches, scales winners
- **Multi-Platform**: Maximizes reach across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, blog
- **AI-First**: GPT-5 + Claude + Pika Labs for content quality
- **Durable**: Temporal workflows survive crashes, auto-retry failures
- **Scalable**: Designed to scale from $0 to $100k+/month

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Backend**: Node.js + Nest.js (unified TypeScript ecosystem)
**Orchestration**: Temporal (durable workflows, auto-retry)
**Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma (relational + JSONB)
**Cache**: Redis (rate limiting, job queue)
**Video**: Pika Labs (cost-effective, fast API)
**AI**: GPT-5 (scripts), Claude 3.5 (blogs), ElevenLabs (voice), DALL-E 3 (thumbnails)
**Hosting**: Fly.io (global edge, Docker, affordable)
**Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, no egress fees)

### Architecture Pattern

```
Temporal Orchestrator (24hr loop)
    ↓
Discovery → Ranking → Content Gen → Publishing → Analytics → Optimization
    ↓                                                               ↓
PostgreSQL (products, content, metrics) ←───────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Modules

1. **Network Discovery**: Auto-discover affiliate APIs, test connectivity
2. **Product Intelligence**: Rank by trend score + profit potential
3. **Content Generator**: Scripts → Voice → Video → Thumbnails → Blogs
4. **Multi-Platform Publisher**: Respect rate limits, optimal timing
5. **Analytics Tracker**: Sync metrics, calculate ROI
6. **Self-Optimizer**: A/B test, kill losers, scale winners
7. **Temporal Orchestrator**: Coordinate all modules, self-healing
