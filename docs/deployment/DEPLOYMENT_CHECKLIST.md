  # Verify rollback
  curl https://ai-affiliate-empire.fly.dev/health
  npm run test:smoke:production
  ```

- [ ] **Verify Rollback Successful**
  - Application functioning normally

## Deployment Metrics

Track these metrics for each deployment:

| Metric | Target | Staging | Production |
|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| Deployment duration | <10 min | __ min | __ min |
| Downtime | 0 min | __ min | __ min |
| Failed health checks | 0 | __ | __ |
| Error spike | No | Yes/No | Yes/No |
| Rollback required | No | Yes/No | Yes/No |
| Time to rollback | <5 min | __ min | __ min |

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Health check fails after deployment

**Symptoms**: `/health` endpoint returns 500 or times out

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check application logs
flyctl logs --app ai-affiliate-empire

# Check database connectivity
flyctl ssh console --app ai-affiliate-empire -C "psql \$DATABASE_URL -c 'SELECT 1'"

# Restart application
flyctl apps restart ai-affiliate-empire

# Rollback if issue persists
./scripts/rollback.sh production
```

### Issue: Database migration fails

**Symptoms**: Application won't start, migration errors in logs

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check migration status
flyctl ssh console --app ai-affiliate-empire -C "npx prisma migrate status"

# Resolve migration (if safe)
flyctl ssh console --app ai-affiliate-empire -C "npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <migration-name>"

# Or rollback database and deployment
./scripts/rollback.sh production
```

### Issue: High error rates after deployment

**Symptoms**: Sentry showing increased errors, customers reporting issues

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check Sentry for error details
# Visit: https://sentry.io/organizations/your-org/projects/ai-affiliate-empire/

# Review recent code changes
git diff <previous-release> <current-release>

# Immediate rollback
./scripts/rollback.sh production

# Fix and redeploy
```

## Approval Gates

### Staging (Automatic)
- All CI checks must pass
- No manual approval required

### Production (Manual)
- Staging deployment must be successful
- Manual approval required from:
  - [ ] Tech Lead
  - [ ] Product Owner
  - [ ] DevOps Engineer (for infrastructure changes)

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:

1. âœ… All health checks passing
2. âœ… No errors in application logs
3. âœ… All smoke tests passing
4. âœ… Response times within SLA
5. âœ… No customer complaints
6. âœ… Monitoring shows normal metrics

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. âœ… Monitor for 24 hours
2. âœ… Update project documentation
3. âœ… Share deployment notes with team
4. âœ… Plan next deployment
5. âœ… Conduct deployment retrospective
