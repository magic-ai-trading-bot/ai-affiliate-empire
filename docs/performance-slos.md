# Service Level Objectives (SLOs) & Monitoring Strategy

**Generated**: 2025-10-31
**Project**: AI Affiliate Empire
**Version**: 1.0
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines Service Level Objectives (SLOs) based on comprehensive load testing results that demonstrate:
- **Zero errors** across 125,000+ requests
- **p95 response time** of 175ms under stress (200 VUs)
- **100% uptime** during all test scenarios
- **Excellent spike recovery** (<120s)

SLOs are set to maintain this exceptional performance while allowing reasonable operational margin.

---

## 1. Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### Definition
SLIs are quantitative measures of service level. We measure these continuously to evaluate performance against SLOs.

### Primary SLIs

#### 1.1 Availability
**Definition**: Percentage of successful HTTP requests (status 2xx/3xx vs. 5xx)

**Measurement**:
```
Availability = (Successful Requests / Total Requests) × 100%
```

**Current Performance**: 100% (0 errors in 125K requests)

---

#### 1.2 Latency
**Definition**: Time from request received to response sent

**Measurements**:
- **p50 (median)**: 50% of requests faster than this
- **p95**: 95% of requests faster than this
- **p99**: 99% of requests faster than this

**Current Performance**:
- p50: 83ms
- p95: 175ms
- p99: ~200ms

---

#### 1.3 Throughput
**Definition**: Number of requests successfully processed per second

**Measurement**:
```
Throughput = Successful Requests / Time Period
```

**Current Performance**: 61 req/s at 200 VUs

---

#### 1.4 Error Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors

**Measurement**:
```
Error Rate = (Failed Requests / Total Requests) × 100%
```

**Current Performance**: 0.00%

---

## 2. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### SLO Framework

SLOs are set using the **4-9s availability framework**:
- **99.9%** (three nines): ~43 minutes downtime/month
- **99.95%**: ~21 minutes downtime/month
- **99.99%** (four nines): ~4 minutes downtime/month

### Our SLO Targets

#### 2.1 Availability SLO
```yaml
Objective: 99.9% availability over 30-day window
Measurement Window: Rolling 30 days
Error Budget: 0.1% = ~43 minutes/month = ~10 hours/year

Acceptable Errors: 1 in 1,000 requests
```

**Rationale**:
- Load testing showed 100% availability
- 99.9% allows operational margin
- Industry standard for non-critical services
- Achievable with single instance

**Error Budget Usage**:
```
Monthly Budget: 43 minutes downtime
- Planned Maintenance: 20 minutes (1x/month)
- Unplanned Incidents: 23 minutes buffer
```

---

#### 2.2 Latency SLO
```yaml
Objective: p95 response time < 500ms
Measurement Window: Rolling 24 hours
Target: 95% of requests < 500ms

Stretch Goal: p95 < 300ms
```

**Rationale**:
- Load testing p95: 175ms (excellent)
- 500ms target allows 2.8x margin
- Meets user expectation for web apps
- Above industry standard (1-2 seconds)

**Per-Endpoint Targets**:

| Endpoint Type | p95 Target | Justification |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Health Check | < 100ms | Simple, no DB query |
| Product List | < 300ms | Database query, caching helps |
| Analytics | < 500ms | Complex aggregations |
| Product Sync | < 2000ms | Bulk operation, less frequent |
| Video Generate | < 10s | AI processing, async acceptable |

---

#### 2.3 Error Rate SLO
```yaml
Objective: Error rate < 0.5% over 24-hour window
Measurement Window: Rolling 24 hours
Target: < 5 errors per 1,000 requests

Stretch Goal: < 0.1% (1 in 1,000)
```

**Rationale**:
- Load testing: 0% error rate
- 0.5% allows for edge cases
- Covers: database errors, timeouts, dependency failures
- Industry standard: 1-5%

**Error Classification**:

| Error Type | Budget Allocation | Acceptable Rate |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Client Errors (4xx) | Not counted | Unlimited |
| Server Errors (5xx) | Primary budget | < 0.5% |
| Timeout Errors | Secondary budget | < 0.1% |
| Dependency Failures | Tertiary budget | < 0.2% |

---

#### 2.4 Throughput SLO
```yaml
Objective: Support 50 req/s sustained throughput
Measurement Window: Rolling 1 hour
Target: Average > 50 req/s during peak hours

Capacity: 61 req/s tested (22% headroom)
```

**Rationale**:
- Load testing: 61 req/s at 200 VUs
- 50 req/s allows 22% safety margin
- Expected production: 5-10 req/s
- 5-10x capacity buffer

**Load Classification**:

| Load Level | Requests/Second | Expected Scenario |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Idle | < 1 | Off-peak hours |
| Normal | 1-10 | Business hours |
| Elevated | 10-30 | Popular content |
| High | 30-50 | Viral content |
| **SLO Limit** | **50** | **Sustained max** |
| Tested Max | 61 | Stress test result |

```

#### 3.2 Availability Commitment

  'http.request.rate': gauge,
  'http.request.errors': counter,
  'http.request.duration': histogram,

  // USE metrics (Utilization, Saturation, Errors)
  'system.cpu.usage': gauge,
  'system.memory.usage': gauge,

## 5. Error Budget Policy

### What is an Error Budget?

Error budget is the acceptable amount of downtime/errors before SLO is violated.

**Calculation**:
```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO Target
For 99.9% SLO: Error Budget = 0.1%

Monthly Budget:
= 0.1% × 30 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes
= 43.2 minutes of downtime allowed per month
```

---

### Error Budget Usage Tracking

#### Budget Allocation
```yaml
Total Budget: 43 minutes/month

Allocation:
  planned_maintenance: 20 minutes (47%)
  unplanned_incidents: 23 minutes (53%)
  buffer: 0 minutes (0%)

Reserve Policy:
  - Keep 10 minutes reserve for emergencies
  - Unused budget does not roll over
```

---

### Error Budget Policies

#### When Budget > 50% Remaining
```yaml
Status: Healthy
Actions:
  - Continue normal operations
  - Deploy during business hours
  - Experiment with new features
  - Perform optional maintenance
```

#### When Budget 20-50% Remaining
```yaml
Status: Caution
Actions:
  - Reduce deployment frequency
  - Deploy only during off-peak hours
  - Increase code review rigor
  - Postpone risky changes
  - Review recent incidents
```

#### When Budget < 20% Remaining
```yaml
Status: Critical
Actions:
  - Freeze all non-critical deployments
  - Cancel planned maintenance
  - Focus on stability improvements
  - Root cause analysis required
  - Manager approval for any changes
  - Incident review meeting
```

#### When Budget Exhausted (0%)
```yaml
Status: SLO Violated
Actions:
  - Immediate deployment freeze
  - Postmortem required
  - Executive escalation
  - Focus only on reliability improvements
  - Review monitoring and alerting
  - Consider architecture changes
```

---

### Error Budget Burn Rate Alerts

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: Fast Burn Rate
    condition: "Burning 7 days budget in 1 hour"
    example: "6 minutes used in 1 hour"
    action: Page on-call immediately

  - name: Moderate Burn Rate
    condition: "Burning 30 days budget in 1 day"
    example: "43 minutes used in 24 hours"
    action: Warning notification

  - name: Slow Burn Rate
    condition: "On track to exceed 30-day budget"

## 8. SLO Review & Update Process

### When to Review SLOs

1. **After Major Incidents**
   - SLO violated multiple times
   - Unrealistic SLO discovered
   - New failure modes identified

2. **Quarterly Schedule**
   - Standard review cycle
   - Compare actuals vs. targets
   - Adjust based on business needs

3. **After Architecture Changes**
   - New services added
   - Technology stack changes
   - Scaling strategy changes

4. **Business Requirement Changes**
   - New customer segments
   - New SLA requirements
   - Competitive pressure

---

### SLO Update Criteria

#### Tighten SLO (Make More Strict) When:
```
✓ Consistently beating target by >20%
✓ User expectations have increased
✓ Competitive pressure
✓ Moving upmarket to enterprise
```

#### Relax SLO (Make Less Strict) When:
```
✓ Consistently missing target
✓ Unrealistic given constraints
✓ Cost to achieve is prohibitive
✓ User satisfaction remains high
```
