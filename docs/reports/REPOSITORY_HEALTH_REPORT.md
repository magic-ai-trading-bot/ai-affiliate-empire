## 2. Security & Secrets Management

### Status: EXCELLENT

#### Automated Security Checks
```
✅ Pre-commit hook: Secret detection
✅ CI/CD: npm audit (dependency scanning)
✅ CI/CD: TruffleHog (secret scanning)
✅ CI/CD: TypeScript strict mode
✅ CI/CD: ESLint security plugin
✅ .gitignore: Sensitive file patterns
✅ Environment: No secrets in git history
```

#### Secret Patterns Protected
- Passwords and passphrases
- API keys and tokens
- AWS credentials and secrets
- Private keys and certificates
- Database connection strings
- Bearer tokens and JWTs

#### Environment Files Status
| File | Status | Protection |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `.env` | Ignored | ✅ Not tracked |
| `.env.local` | Ignored | ✅ Not tracked |
| `.env.*.local` | Ignored | ✅ Not tracked |
| `.env.example` | Tracked | ✅ Template only |
| `.env.production.example` | Tracked | ✅ Template only |

#### Vault Integration
- ✅ AWS Secrets Manager configured (production)
- ✅ GitHub Secrets for CI/CD variables
- ✅ Fallback to local .env (development)

#### Recommendations
- Monitor for accidental secret commits
- Regular credential rotation
- Audit log monitoring
- Use GitHub Secret Scanning feature
