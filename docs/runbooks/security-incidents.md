## P0: Critical Security Incidents

### Unauthorized Access Detected

**Indicators:**
- Unusual admin panel access from unknown IPs
- Database queries from unauthorized sources
- Unexpected API calls with valid credentials
- AWS/Fly.io console access from unknown location

**Immediate Response (< 5 minutes):**

1. **Confirm Breach**
   ```bash
   # Check recent access logs
   flyctl logs --app ai-affiliate-empire | grep -i "unauthorized\|access denied\|403\|401"

   # Check database access logs
   flyctl postgres connect --app ai-affiliate-empire-db
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;

   # Check for suspicious queries
   SELECT usename, query, state, query_start
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE usename NOT IN ('postgres', 'app_user')
   OR query LIKE '%DROP%'
   OR query LIKE '%DELETE%';
   ```

2. **Contain Breach** (< 2 minutes)
   ```bash
   # If confirmed unauthorized access:

   # Option 1: Block IP immediately
   # Via Fly.io dashboard or:
   flyctl ips block <suspicious-ip> --app ai-affiliate-empire

   # Option 2: Rotate ALL credentials
   ./scripts/emergency-credential-rotation.sh

   # Option 3: Take application offline (last resort)
   flyctl scale count 0 --app ai-affiliate-empire
   ```

3. **Revoke Access** (< 3 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Revoke all active sessions
   flyctl postgres connect --app ai-affiliate-empire-db

   # Kill all active connections
   SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE pid != pg_backend_pid();

   # Invalidate all auth tokens
   DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expires_at > NOW();
   ```

4. **Notify Team** (< 1 minute)
   ```bash
   # Send emergency alert
   ./.claude/send-discord.sh 'ðŸš¨ SECURITY INCIDENT: Unauthorized access detected. System contained. Investigating. DO NOT share details publicly.'

   # Page security team
   # Notify management
   # DO NOT post details in public channels
   ```

5. **Preserve Evidence** (< 5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Save all logs immediately
   flyctl logs --app ai-affiliate-empire > security-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log

   # Export database audit logs
   flyctl postgres connect --app ai-affiliate-empire-db
   COPY (SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity) TO '/tmp/db-activity.csv' CSV HEADER;

   # Save application state
   curl https://ai-affiliate-empire.fly.dev/api/admin/state-dump > state-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).json
   ```

**Investigation (< 30 minutes):**

1. **Identify Entry Point**
   - Compromised credentials?
   - SQL injection?
   - XSS vulnerability?
   - Social engineering?

2. **Assess Damage**
   ```bash
   # Check what data was accessed
   flyctl postgres connect --app ai-affiliate-empire-db

   # Check for data modifications
   SELECT * FROM audit_log
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;

   # Check for data exfiltration
   # Review large SELECT queries
   SELECT query, query_start
   FROM pg_stat_activity_history
   WHERE query LIKE '%SELECT%'
   AND length(query) > 1000;
   ```

3. **Document Timeline**
   - When was breach detected?
   - When did breach likely start?
   - What actions were taken?
   - What data was compromised?

**Remediation:**

1. **Rotate All Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Rotate API keys
   flyctl secrets set \
     OPENAI_API_KEY=new-key \
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=new-key \
     DATABASE_URL=new-url \
     --app ai-affiliate-empire

   # Rotate database password
   flyctl postgres users password postgres --app ai-affiliate-empire-db

   # Generate new JWT secrets
   flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32) --app ai-affiliate-empire
   ```

2. **Patch Vulnerability**
   - Fix code vulnerability
   - Update dependencies
   - Apply security patches
   - Deploy fix immediately

3. **Restore Service** (only after secured)
   ```bash
   # Verify all credentials rotated
   # Verify vulnerability patched
   # Verify no backdoors remain

   # Scale up slowly
   flyctl scale count 1 --app ai-affiliate-empire

   # Monitor for 30 minutes
   # Check for suspicious activity

   # If clean, scale to full capacity
   flyctl scale count 2 --app ai-affiliate-empire
   ```

---

### API Key Compromise

**Indicators:**
- API key found in public GitHub repo
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Costs spike unexpectedly
- Rate limit errors from unknown sources

**Immediate Response (< 5 minutes):**

1. **Confirm Compromise**
   ```bash
   # Check API usage
   curl https://api.openai.com/v1/usage  # Check OpenAI usage

   # Check for unusual patterns
   # - Requests from unknown IPs
   # - Spike in request volume
   # - Unusual request patterns

   # Search GitHub for leaked keys
   # https://github.com/search?q=sk-proj-[YOUR_KEY]&type=code
   ```

2. **Revoke Compromised Key** (< 1 minute)
   ```bash
   # Revoke on provider side immediately
   # OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   # Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   # Others: respective dashboards

   # Generate new key
   # Update in application
   flyctl secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=new-key --app ai-affiliate-empire
   ```

3. **Verify No Unauthorized Usage**
   ```bash
   # Check billing for unauthorized charges
   # OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/usage
   # Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/billing

   # Document unauthorized usage
   # Prepare for potential dispute
   ```

4. **Scan for Other Exposed Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Scan codebase for hardcoded secrets
   npm install -g trufflehog

   trufflehog filesystem ./ \
     --json \
     --exclude-paths .trufflehog-exclude.txt \
     > secret-scan-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

   # Check git history
   git log -p | grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password" > potential-leaks.txt
   ```

**Prevention:**

1. **Remove from Public Repositories**
   ```bash
   # If key was committed to git:

   # Option 1: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner
   bfg --replace-text passwords.txt repo.git
   git push --force

   # Option 2: GitHub secret scanning
   # GitHub automatically detects and alerts on secrets
   # Respond to alerts immediately
   ```

2. **Implement Secrets Scanning**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml
   name: Secret Scan
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     scan:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
           with:
             path: ./
             base: main
             head: HEAD
   ```

3. **Use Secrets Manager**
   ```bash
   # Migrate to AWS Secrets Manager
   npm run migrate:secrets

   # Enable in production
   flyctl secrets set AWS_SECRETS_MANAGER_ENABLED=true --app ai-affiliate-empire
   ```

   # - API credentials?
   # - Affiliate links/tracking data?

   # Determine scope
   # - How many records?
   # - What sensitivity level?
   # - How was it accessed?
   ```

2. **Contain Breach**
   ```bash
   # Stop data exfiltration
   flyctl ips block <attacker-ip> --app ai-affiliate-empire

   # Lock down database
   flyctl postgres connect --app ai-affiliate-empire-db

   # Revoke public access (if any)
   REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM public;

   # Restrict to application only
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app_user;
   ```

3. **Legal Notification** (CRITICAL)
   ```bash
   # Immediately notify:
   # - Legal counsel
   # - Compliance officer
   # - Data protection officer (if applicable)

   # Determine breach notification requirements:
   # - GDPR: 72 hours
   # - CCPA: Without unreasonable delay
   # - Other jurisdictions as applicable
   ```

4. **Preserve Evidence**
   ```bash
   # Full database snapshot
   flyctl postgres backup create --app ai-affiliate-empire-db

   # Export affected records
   flyctl postgres connect --app ai-affiliate-empire-db
   COPY (SELECT * FROM affected_table WHERE ...) TO '/tmp/breach-data.csv' CSV HEADER;

   # Save all logs
   flyctl logs --app ai-affiliate-empire --all > full-breach-logs.txt
   ```

**Remediation:**

1. **Assess Impact**
   - Number of affected users/records
   - Type of data compromised
   - Potential harm to individuals
   - Regulatory implications

2. **Notification Plan**
   ```
   Timeline:
   - T+0: Confirm breach
   - T+24h: Notify legal/compliance
   - T+48h: Draft notification (if required)
   - T+72h: Notify authorities (GDPR)
   - T+1 week: Notify affected users

   Notification Content:
   - What happened
   - What data was affected
   - What we're doing
   - What users should do
   - Contact information
   ```

3. **Post-Breach Security Audit**
   - Full security assessment
   - Penetration testing
   - Code review
   - Infrastructure audit
