   - Severity-based alerts (critical, warning, success, info)
   - Color-coded Discord embeds
   - Reusable for all alert types

   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitoring/send-discord-alert.sh success "Deployment" "Production deploy completed"
   ./scripts/monitoring/send-discord-alert.sh critical "Backup Failed" "Database backup failed"
   ```

2. **Backup Status Monitor**
   - **File:** `scripts/monitoring/check-backup-status.sh`
   - Monitors last backup age
   - Alerts if backup >24 hours old
   - Cron-ready for hourly checks

   ```cron
   0 * * * * /path/to/scripts/monitoring/check-backup-status.sh
   ```

3. **API Health Monitor**
   - **File:** `scripts/monitoring/check-api-health.sh`
   - Health endpoint monitoring (/health, /api/health)
   - Automatic failure alerts
   - Cron-ready for 5-minute intervals

   ```cron
   */5 * * * * /path/to/scripts/monitoring/check-api-health.sh
   ```

#### Configuration
- **File:** `config/monitoring.json` (auto-generated)
- Discord alert rules
- Sentry error tracking configuration
- Health check intervals and timeouts
- Backup monitoring thresholds

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test configuration
./scripts/setup/setup-monitoring.sh -t

# Setup with credentials
./scripts/setup/setup-monitoring.sh -e production \
  -d https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... \
  -s https://...@sentry.io/...
```

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY

---

### ✅ 3. Security Enhancement

**Updated:** `.gitignore`

Added explicit protection for secrets files:
```gitignore
**/*.secrets
```

Ensures generated secrets files (`.env.*.secrets`) are never committed to git.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
