## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risk**: ‚úÖ LOW
- Strong infrastructure with automated rollback
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Well-documented deployment procedures

**Security Risk**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
- Auth not implemented (acceptable for internal MVP)
- Security hardening incomplete
- Mitigated by: Rate limiting, secrets management, security scanning

**Operational Risk**: ‚úÖ LOW

2. Test backup restoration (2 hours)
3. Configure deployment secrets (1 hour)

### Launch Day
1. Deploy to production using blue-green strategy
2. Monitor closely for first 48 hours
3. Validate all dashboards and alerts
4. Run smoke tests

### Week 1 Post-Launch
1. Run load tests with real traffic
2. Implement authentication/authorization
3. Create operational runbooks
4. Monitor performance and optimize

### Month 1 Post-Launch
1. Increase test coverage to 75%
2. Implement cost monitoring dashboard
3. Create disaster recovery runbook
4. Define and monitor SLOs

- 99.5% uptime
- Error rate <1%
- p95 latency <3s
- No data loss incidents
- Authentication implemented

‚úÖ **Week 2**:
- Security headers implemented
- Operational runbooks created
- Cost monitoring active
- Load testing complete

‚úÖ **Month 1**:
- Test coverage 60%+
- DR runbook complete
- Compliance documentation final
- SLOs defined and monitored

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Legal**: Need DPA for EU users? COPPA compliance required?
2. **Infrastructure**: Acceptable RTO/RPO? Multi-region deployment needed?
3. **Operations**: Who is on-call? Escalation path? SLAs defined?
4. **Business**: Max acceptable cost? When to scale instances?
5. **Technical**: Blue-green at DB level? CDC for analytics? Managed Temporal Cloud?

---

## Key Metrics

**Infrastructure**:
- 85+ TypeScript source files
- 9 test suites (unit, E2E, smoke)
- 15+ documentation files
- 14 database models (Prisma)

**External Integrations**:
- ‚úÖ OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon, ElevenLabs, Pika Labs
- ‚è≥ YouTube, TikTok, Instagram (planned)

**Operating Costs**:
- $412/month fixed + variable
- $0.27 per content piece
- Break-even: $412/month
- Target: $10,000/month (2426% ROI)

**Deployment Options**:
- Fly.io (recommended, configured)
- Railway (alternative, documented)
- Kubernetes (enterprise, manifests ready)

---

## Final Recommendation

**GO FOR LAUNCH** ‚úÖ

**Confidence**: HIGH (8.5/10)

**Rationale**:
System demonstrates strong production readiness across critical dimensions. Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, and documentation are enterprise-grade. Gaps in load testing and authentication are addressable post-launch and do not block MVP deployment for internal system.

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete 2 critical pre-launch actions (6 hours)
2. Deploy to production using automated pipeline
3. Monitor closely for 48 hours
4. Execute Week 1 post-launch priorities
